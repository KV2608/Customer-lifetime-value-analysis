# Customer Lifetime Value Analysis

## Project Overview
Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) analysis is used to estimate the total value of customers to the business over the lifetime of their relationship. This analysis helps businesses make data-driven decisions on resource allocation, customer acquisition, and retention strategies. This project demonstrates how to perform CLTV analysis using Python.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is `customer_acquisition_data.csv`. It contains the following columns:
- `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `channel`: The acquisition channel for the customer (e.g., referral, paid advertising, email marketing, social media).
- `cost`: The acquisition cost for the customer.
- `conversion_rate`: The conversion rate of the customer.
- `revenue`: The revenue generated by the customer.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- plotly

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas plotly


**Steps for Analysis**

Load the Dataset: Start by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

Visualize Data: Create histograms to visualize the distribution of acquisition costs and revenues.

Compare Acquisition Costs by Channel: Use bar charts to compare the average acquisition costs across different channels.

Analyze Conversion Rates by Channel: Use bar charts to compare the conversion rates across different channels.

Calculate Total Revenue by Channel: Use pie charts to visualize the total revenue generated by each channel.

Calculate ROI by Channel: Compute the Return on Investment (ROI) for each channel and visualize it using bar charts.

Calculate CLTV by Channel: Compute the Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) for each channel and visualize it using bar charts.

Compare CLTV Distributions: Use box plots to compare the CLTV distributions of the most profitable channels.


**Summary**

Customer lifetime value analysis is essential for understanding the total value of customers to the business over their relationship. It helps companies determine investment strategies for customer acquisition and retention and identifies the most valuable customers to focus on. This project provides a comprehensive guide to performing CLTV analysis using Python.
